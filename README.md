**Hi my name is Noufal Kuruppillath**

	I currently work with Cent OS (at work) and Debian on my personal projects.

	I am currently taking the web-developer learning path from **free code camp** and the **Odin project**.

	Hopefully, in near future, I will be contributing to **FOSS** projects and stuff!.
